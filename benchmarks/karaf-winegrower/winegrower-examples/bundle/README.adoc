= Apache Winegrower - Bundle example

This example is a little more complete.

It creates a OSGi bundle with a bundle activator which register a service.

The example includes a test based on the Winegrower JUnit 5 extension.

The created OSGi bundle can be used in Winegrower or on a "concrete" OSGi framework like Apache Karaf with Felix or Equinox.

== Dependencies

The only dependency you need is `winegrower-core` and `winegrower-extension-testing-junit5` for the test.
