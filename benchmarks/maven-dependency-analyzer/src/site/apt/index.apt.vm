${project.name}

  Analyzes the dependencies of a project for undeclared or unused artifacts.

  <<Warning>>: Because analysis is done on the bytecode rather than the source,
  some cases are not detected including constants, annotations with source-only retention, 
  and links in Javadoc. This can lead to incorrect results when these are the only uses
  of a dependency.

  The main component is <<<ProjectDependencyAnalyzer>>>
  ({{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/dependency/analyzer/ProjectDependencyAnalyzer.html}javadoc}}), which uses
  <<<ClassAnalyzer>>>
  ({{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/dependency/analyzer/ClassAnalyzer.html}javadoc}})
  and <<<DependencyAnalyzer>>>
  ({{{./apidocs/org/apache/maven/shared/dependency/analyzer/DependencyAnalyzer.html}javadoc}}).
