        <!-- NOTE: Most of the following excludes should not be required 
             if the standard release process is followed. This is because the 
             release plugin checks out project sources into a location like
             target/checkout, then runs the build from there. The result is
             a source-release archive that comes from a pretty clean directory
             structure.
             
             HOWEVER, if the release plugin is configured to run extra goals
             or generate a project website, it's definitely possible that some
             of these files will be present. So, it's safer to exclude them.
