	<description>
		In order to properly test OSGi-loaded t2ference modules
		we need a module that is entire external
		to t2reference and to the test cases. If the test
		implementations are included in either the api, core
		implementations or test modules they will be loaded by the root
		classloader of the test runner - by putting them in an
		independent artifact we allow them to be loaded through
		various SPI discovery mechanisms as they would be in a 'real'
		environment.
