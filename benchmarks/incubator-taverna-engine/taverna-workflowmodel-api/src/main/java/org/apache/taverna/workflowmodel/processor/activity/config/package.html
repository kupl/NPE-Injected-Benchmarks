<body>
A set of helper classes to aid in defining how Activities are configured.
An Activity class is associated with a ConfigurationType, which is an arbitrary Java object defining
how the Activity should be configured.<br>
This package provides classes and interfaces that help in creating these ConfigurationTypes with details that are common
across different Activities, but there use is in no way enforced.
