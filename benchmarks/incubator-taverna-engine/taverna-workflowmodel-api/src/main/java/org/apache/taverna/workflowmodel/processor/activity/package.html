<body>
Provides definitions for a single Activity to be contained within a
Processor. Activity was previously called 'Service' but this was
somewhat misleading as there wasn't always a service backing it. The
Activity may be abstract, it may be synchronous or asynchronous in which
case it uses a callback mechanism. It doesn't carry around annotation
itself instead using an activity annotation container to handle this
(this avoids third parties having to manage annotation containment
themselves).
