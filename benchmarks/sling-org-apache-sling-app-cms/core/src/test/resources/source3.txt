Houston, Ryan Gosling has a little issue with this whole career thing.

The 37-year-old actor confessed that his two young daughters with Eva Mendes are convinced he's a real astronaut after seeing him at work on "First Man," his biopic on astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon.

Gosling said on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" Wednesday that the two girls visited him on the set of "First Man" and saw him in the full astronaut gig. It made an impression.

"They came to set and they came on this day where I was shooting a launch scene," Gosling told Kimmel. "So I was in the space suit and pretending to launch. I think they think I'm an astronaut now."

Esmeralda, 4, even took it a step further when discussing her father's supposed workplace.

"My oldest said the other day, she pointed to the moon and she was like, 'That's where you work, right?'" Gosling said.
