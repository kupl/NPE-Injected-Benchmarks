The word logorrhoea is often used pejoratively 
to describe prose that is highly abstract and 
contains little concrete language. Since abstract 
writing is hard to visualize, it often seems as though 
it makes no sense and all the words are excessive. 
Writers in academic fields that concern themselves mostly 
with the abstract, such as philosophy and especially 
postmodernism, often fail to include extensive concrete 
examples of their ideas, and so a superficial examination 
of their work might lead one to believe that it is all nonsense.
