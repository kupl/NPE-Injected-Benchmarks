Maven Archetype Catalog Model

 This is strictly the model for Maven Archetype Catalog used to contain information about Archetypes so that users
    can be presented with a list of archetypes from any number of catalogs to generate new
    projects.

 The following are generated from this model:

   * {{{./apidocs/index.html}Java sources}} with Reader and Writers for the Xpp3 XML parser

   * A {{{./archetype-catalog.html}Descriptor Reference}}

   * An XSD referenced in the {{{./archetype-catalog.html}Descriptor Reference}}.
