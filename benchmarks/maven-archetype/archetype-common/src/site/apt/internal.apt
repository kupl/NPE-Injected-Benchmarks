Maven Archetype Internal Catalog

 The Archetype Plugin comes bundled with an internal catalog.

* Updating the Internal Catalog

 The source for internal catalog is hosted in the {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Archetypes+List}Archetype List}}
 page of the Maven User Wiki.

 This page is transformed to a catalog XML file using following command in <<<archetype-common>>> module directory:

----
mvn -P internal-catalog test
----

 Then merge <<<target/archetype-catalog.xml>>> with
 {{{http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/archetype/trunk/archetype-common/src/main/resources/archetype-catalog.xml?view=markup}<<<src/main/resources/archetype-catalog.xml>>>}}.
